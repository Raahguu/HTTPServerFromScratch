# HTTPServerFromScratch
A HTTP server framework that I made from scratch in python

This is a python project where I have developed a framework that can be used to efficently create HTTP websites modeled after Flask, as I don't have much experience with other backend frameworks at the moement

## Future plan

I hope to oneday add HTTPS support, rather then the current, throw an error whenever a HTTPS request comes in
